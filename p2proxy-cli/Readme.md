# P2proxy cli

A cli app for launching p2proxyd services.

## Running it

Either build it from source `cargo r -r -p p2proxy-cli`, or invoke the binary directly.

## Usage

The cli has its own usage instructions.
In short, it can be used to generate a new secret key, or to launch a local proxy connection
to some remote `p2proxyd` service.
